I got bored of javascript on the server side and decided to try another language i had the choice of either learning golang or python but decided to go with golang because at this point i was more interested in cloud native technologies and Devops. Another reason why i choosed go was because of its speed and have also tried python about a year ago but i didn't really enjoy it. 
In the next 50 days i will be actively building projects and mini games using this language and i will document my progress here.

#### Day one (25th-may-2021)
I googled for the best resources to learn golang and i selected a few resources that used a project bassed learning approach so here are a few of them i found.

- I also got a udemy Course by stephen Grider [GO the complete developers guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/) - would strongly recommend it to anyone.

I also decided to start this blog ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.


#### Day Two (26th-may-2021)

##### more about Golang

- Go is a compiled language => that is a language that is compiled straight into machine code 

- types of languages => Compiled vs Interpreted

- Go is a strictly typed language

- computers need machine code. In order to supply the CPU with an instruction set that it's hardware is familiar with, we need to convert our high-level (Go) code into machine language. The Go compiler's job is to take Go code and produce a program (machine code).

- Go programs are fairly lightweight. Each program includes a small amount of "extra" code that's included in the executable binary. This extra code is called the Go Runtime. One of the purposes of the Go runtime
is to cleanup unused memory.

#### Day 3 - 8 (27th - 31st may)

- learnt about control flows in golang 
- loops 
- structs
- got more confortable with searching through the golang docs
- built a simple golang quiz application


#### Day 9 - 15 (1st June to 6th June) 
 Been really unsteady about my learning because i had to get up to speed with cloud engineering, registered for two courses on coursera where i will be learning about migrating to cloud native environment and handling containers in AWS environment. Nothing less i learnt

 - Interfaces in golang => its a really confusing topic.
 - More on structs types and Scopes. 
 - Pointers and memory allocation in golang.
 - Started building an uptime monitor with my knowledge of structs and interfaces.
