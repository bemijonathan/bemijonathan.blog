I got bored of javascript on the server side and decided to try another language i had the choice of either learning golang or python but decided to go with golang more because at this point i was a lot more interested in cloud native technologies and Devops. I choosed go mostly because of its speed, also i tried python before and didn't really enjoy it. In the next 50 days i will be actively building projects/mini games using this language and i will document my progress here.

#### Day one (25th-may-2021)
I googled for the best resources to learn golang and i selected a few resources that used a project bassed learning approach so here are a few of them i found.
