This is the birth of my blog i decided to use my extra time to commit to my growth and developement as i journey to become a senior software engineer.

As at the date above this is my third year coding proffesionally, and i would love to move to the next phase of my career but would love to do so by documenting the process so other engineers can learn from what i did right and also what i did wrong... (scuffs!) something i should have started earlier in my career. 

I'm going to write about my observations experiences, growth, things i learned, it's going to be a lot about Javascript, Vue , React and NodeJs since i am very proficient in Javascript technologies, i hope to learn more cloud technologies and get very proficient in golang, i would also let you know what i am currently up to so stay put let make this journey into world class engineers together.
